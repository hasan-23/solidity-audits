- ✅ Implements `onlyOwner` and `whenNotPaused` modifiers  
- ✅ Prevents 0-value deposit/withdrawals  
- ✅ Checks for sufficient balance

### ⚠️ Issues Found

| ID | Severity | Issue                            | Recommendation                     |
|----|----------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1  | Medium 🟡 | No ownership transfer mechanism   | Add `transferOwnership()` function |
| 2  | Low 🟢    | No `receive()` or `fallback()`    | Explicitly define to reject ETH    |

## 🧠 Code Quality Review

- Code readability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐✰  
- Variable naming: ✅ Clear  
- Error messages: ✅ Custom & useful  
- Modifiers: ✅ Reusable & clean

## 📘 Recommendations

- Add `transferOwnership()` to allow secure ownership changes.  
- Implement `receive()` function to control direct ETH transfers.  
- Consider using `SafeMath` for production-grade use (or built-in overflow checks in 0.8+).
