# 🛡 Solidity Smart Contract Audits

Welcome to my smart contract audit repository.

I’m Hasan — a Web3 security researcher and Solidity developer focused on secure smart contract development, code reviews, and audit reporting.

This repository contains structured audits of my analyzed Solidity projects, including access control, logic validation, and security best practices.

## 🚀 Learning Goal

This repo is part of my **Solidity Roadmap**, where I’m building public proof of skills in:

- Smart contract auditing  
- Solidity security research  
- Freelance/Web3 career building

Stay tuned as I grow through code, audits, and secure decentralized systems.
